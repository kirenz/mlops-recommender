# Recommender Systems with Metaflow Tutorial

This repo is based on a tutorial by [Outerbound](https://outerbounds.com/docs/recsys-tutorial-overview/) about training recommender systems using Metaflow to provide a scalable workflow you can use for experimentation and production. 

The goal is to develop a relatively simple, effective, and general pipeline for sequential recommendations, and show how you can use popular open-source libraries and tools including DuckDB, Gensim, Metaflow, and Keras to build a fully working cloud endpoint that serves predictions in real-time, starting from raw data.
